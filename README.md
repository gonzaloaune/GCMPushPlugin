# Push Notifications for Cordova

## Description

Implementation of Push Notifications using the new GCM that Google featured in their 2015 Google I/O conference: https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/

### Attention!
This plugin only works with the latest Cordova 5 release, it uses Gradle for Android.

As the time of this writing it is tested to the extend "It works for me" :-)

If you're looking for a node module that implements all the GCM functionality on the server side, I may propose
[node-gcm](https://github.com/ToothlessGear/node-gcm)!

##<a name="android-install"></a> Android installation

Assuming you have your Cordova application up and running:

1) Go to https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/start and generate the configuration file.

2) Apperantly Google advices to put your configuration file inside an "android-proj/app" or "android-proj/mobile" folder. 
However, this doesn't seem to work, so I ended up putting this file in *../platforms/android* **AND** *../platforms/android/CordovaLib*

3) Apply the Gradle configuration from this site [https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client) The important lines are:
```
//Add the dependency to your project's top-level build.gradle:
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.3.1'

//Add the plugin to your app-level build.gradle:
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

//Set Up Google Play Services
dependencies {
  compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.8.0"
}
```
**ATTENTION:** Watch out for new versions of *play-services* and *google-services*. The initial build may fail if the given versions are not available for download anymore!
And you may also add
```
repositories {
	jcenter()
}
```
to tell Gradle where to find the downloads!

**ATTENTION:** Cordova will overwrite the build.gradle files everytime you run *cordova build*! The advice is to edit the file *build-extras.gradle* instead. However, I could not figure out how these files get merged during the build. So again I ended up editing the original files for the time being. I appreciate every hint on this.
 
4) Run `cordova plugin add https://github.com/akreienbring/GCMPushPlugin.git` to install the plugin

##<a name="usage"></a> Usage

### Registration

The `init` method will register your Token with GCM. The way to call it is the following:

```js
pushPlugin = window.GcmPushPlugin.init({
	"senderId": <YOUR TOKEN>
});

```
#### Options (Android only)
The following options may be provided besides the mandatory senderId:

| Option        			| Description           								| Type  	| Default  	|
| --------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------:| --------:	| ---------:|
| icon	      				| the path to a local icon for the notification 		| String	| ""	 	|
| iconColor    				| the background color of the icon 						| String	| ""	 	|
| sound	    				| play a sound when a notification is created?			| boolean	| true	 	|
| vibrate    				| vibrate when a notification is created?				| boolean	| true	 	|
| clearNotifications		| clear notifications when app goes to background?		| boolean	| true	 	|
| notificationInForeground	| create a notification when the app is in foreground?	| boolean	| false	 	|
| dataInBackground			| emit 'dataReceived' when the app is in background?	| boolean	| false	 	|

### Events (Android only)
You may listen to the follwing events once you called the `init` method.
```
pushPlugin.on('registrationCompleted', function(result) {
  var registrationId = result.registrationId;
}

pushPlugin.on('error', function(err) {
	console.log(err);
});

pushPlugin.on('dataReceived', function(data) {
	//data is an object that has a 'messages' property
	//there may be multiple messages when they were received while the app was in background
	var messages = data.messages;
});

pushPlugin.on('notificationClicked', function(data) {
	//data is an object with the properties of the data section of the received gcm message
	console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
});
```
### Methods (Android only)
#### Unregister
The `unregister` method will unregister your Token / RegistrationId from GCM. There's no event fired when you unregister, but an error is emitted if something fails.
```
pushPlugin.unregister();
```

#### Subscribe to a topic
You may also subscribe to one ore more topics.
```
pushPlugin.subscribeTopics(["topic1", "topic2"]);
```

#### Unsubscribe from a topic
To unsubscribe use the following:
```
pushPlugin.unsubscribeTopics(["topic1", "topic2"]);
```

#### Get cached data
When the app is in background mode and the `dataInBackground` is not set to true (which is the default), the plugin caches all incoming data.
To get the cached data from the plugin you may use
```
pushPlugin.getCachedData();
```
when the app resumes. The date will then be emitted with the `dataReceived` event.

##<a name="ios-install-gcm"></a> Notes on iOS
This is a fork of [https://github.com/gonzaloaune/GCMPushPlugin](https://github.com/gonzaloaune/GCMPushPlugin)
BTW: Thanks for the work to Gonzalo Aune! 
His plugin has iOS support, but I think I broke the compatibility with my changes.
However: I submitted a Pullrequest to Gonzalo and hopefully he will integrate my changes and restore the iOs functionality!

##<a name="contribute"></a> Contribute
Feel free to contribute. But.. as I said, this is a fork. So once merged by Gonzalo all contributions should go to the original.
